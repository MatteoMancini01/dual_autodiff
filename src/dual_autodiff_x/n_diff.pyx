'''
The following class is designed to perform numerical differentiation.
'''
cdef class NumDiff:
    '''
    In this class there are four different functions, first order numericall differentiation with
    forward, central and backward difference and one function to compute second order derivative numerically.
    '''
    # Declare attributes for Cython optimization
    cdef object f  # Function object (canâ€™t type explicitly in Cython)
    cdef double x, h  # Numerical input (double for optimization)

    def __init__(self, f, x, h):
        '''
        Initialising input.

        Parameters:
            f is the input function we aim to differentiate,
            x is/are the value/s at which the function is differentiated,
            h is the step size required for numerical differentiation. In general h<<0 provides accurate results, but if h is too small
              we lose rather than gaining accuracy.
